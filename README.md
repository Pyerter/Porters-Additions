#Minecraft Mod - Porter's Additions - WIP

This project is my first attempt at creating a Minecraft mod.

Created through use of the Forge Mod Loader for Minecraft.

The goal of this project is to create a lot of cool additions to Minecraft that hopefully complement both vanilla and modded playstyles.
Currently, I've only implemented new tiers of weapons and armor through recipes. Hopefully, I'll find some time to add more in the future.
