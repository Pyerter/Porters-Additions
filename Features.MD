## Implemented Features
This is a list of features currently in the game. A guide will be created later on to give all recipes and linear instructions for this mod.

- Materials:
  - Sapphire: unlike traditional sapphires, this is sapphire dust that turns into stars, harnessing magical energy
    - Tool tier set: Sapphire Star (sword, pick, axe, shovel, hoe)
  - Celestial Manipulator: harnessing the power of Sapphire and Nether Stars, this manipulator can store and modify energy of these inside of a celestial container.
    - The Celestial Container: stores star power and can be slotted into tools to modify their potential.
    - Celestial Focuses: these tools are special tools that allow more advanced harnessing of celestial containers.
      - Staff: a more robust and powerful focus that channels powerful, yet slow energy
      - Wand: a more agile and flexible focus that channels managable power at great speed
